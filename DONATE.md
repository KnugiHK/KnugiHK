# Donation Guide

Welcome to the donation guide! If you're interested in supporting me, here are a few simple guidelines to follow.

**Please make sure to read them before making a donation.**

## Cryptocurrency-Only Donations
Donations are accepted only in the form of cryptocurrencies. Please note that fiat currency or any other forms of donation are not accepted at this time.

Supported cryptocurrencies and addresses:

- Bitcoin: bc1qm2cfq63xk69dg5apkfn7xttfe0d87d0wke33sv
- Monero: 86SQDTgjRf3YZWbBTvVx1eD2GRdVn4S2zSdMH4aWGFxyVGkLK2aZXH2BnqPXpckm1zCuatu7uv3A5MTUjsEcGXTMVo2tku1

The QR code can be found in the buttom on this page.

## Direct Support for KnugiHK
All donations go directly to me personally, not to any specific project. Basically, you are just giving me money for the sole reason: *support me and nothing else*. This approach ensures that my work remains independent and free from outside influence. If you’re not comfortable with this and still wish to support a particular project, see the next section.

## How to Support a Particular Project
If you're looking to support a specific project (e.g., WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter), the best way to help is by sharing and promoting it. Spread the word on social media, with friends, or in your community. None of my projects accept direct financial contributions—support is strictly through awareness and promotion.

You can also contribute to my projects by submitting pull requests or reporting bugs. Your help is greatly appreciated!

## For Those Who Wish to Contribute Financially to a Pariticular Project
If you prefer to offer financial support but want it to go toward a project, you can still donate directly to me through the listed cryptocurrency options. Your contribution will be used as I see fit, but please note that there are no guarantees or expectations tied to your donation.

## Lastly, a HUGE THANK YOU to all supporters
Thanks for all supporters, whether you donate or simply help spread the word or by contributing!

Together, we make the open source community STRONGER!
